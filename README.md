## Introduction
Automotive 4-Channel TFT-LCD Power Supply with VCOM Buffer and ASIL B Features using MAX25222.

### MAX25222
The MAX25222/MAX25222C are 4-channel TFT-LCD power ICs that provide symmetrical positive AVDD and negative NAVDD supplies as well as VGON and VGOFF gate supplies. In addition, a VCOM buffer with output voltage range above and below ground and a temperature measurement block are integrated.

## Schematic
Schematic is designed in Easy EDA and references have been taken from datasheet.

## PCB 
PCB is design is of 40 layers. References are taken from datasheet but it is highly recommended to consult datasheet for EMI considerations.
